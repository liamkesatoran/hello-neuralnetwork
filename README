These are all "hand made" implementations of neural networks in Python,
I didn't want to use keras / tensorflow / pytorch for this because I wanted to undererstand more the maths behind NN.

TO DO NEXT :
- Follow a full class ?
- Cross entropy
- Convolutional neural networks
- Unsupervised learning
- Natural Selection learning



Done :

- Deep Q Learning using Keras on OpenAI Gym
- Minibatch stochastic gradient descent
- Q learning on OpenAI's FrozenLake
- Tensorflow usage exemple
- OpenAI Gym setup
- n arbitrary layers neural network with back propagation 
- 2 layer neural network with back propagation 
- class perceptron with back propagation 
- fast perecptron with back propagation
