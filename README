Done :

- Minibatch stochastic gradient descent
- Q learning on OpenAI's FrozenLake
- Tensorflow usage exemple
- OpenAI Gym setup
- n arbitrary layers neural network with back propagation 
- 2 layer neural network with back propagation 
- class perceptron with back propagation 
- fast perecptron with back propagation
